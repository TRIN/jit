{"name":"PhyloJIVE","tagline":"Integrating online biodiversity data with the Tree of Life","body":"### About\r\n\r\nphyloJIVE provides Interactive Visualizations for phylogenies. Species and other taxa  can be linked by name or GUID to biodiversity data sources.\r\n\r\nPhyloJIVE operates as a client-side web application that renders phyloge-nies on a HTML5 canvas. Written in JavaScript, it requires no plug-ins. Performance is determined by the viewer’s computer.\r\n\r\n### Components\r\n PhyloJIVE has three components: \r\n\r\n* PhylogenyExplorer \r\n* PhyloJIVE* \r\n* charJSON  \r\n\r\n_PhylogenyExplorer_ is an extension to the JIT, Javascript Infovis Toolkit , library that adds a novel, compact tree visualization with variable length branches. Actions and online data sources can be linked to every node. \r\n\r\n_PhyloJIVE*_ is a set of web application templates that wrap around a PhylogenyExplorer visualization. It provides the means to navigate the tree and its component clades; to adjust the visualization and other parameters; to select taxon character states; to upload of trees in newick form and char-acter sets in CSV or charJSON form; to fetch character sets from Identify Life; and to display the results of web service queries (e.g. species pages, maps, images) on the tree. Clades with up to 32 taxa can be selected and sent to a web service. Sets of up to ten quantitative or qualitative characters can be mapped onto the tree. Character states are reconstructed using sim-ple algorithms (see supplemental information); a summary of which ap-pears in the application when the mouse pointer hovers over a node. \r\n\r\n_charJSON_ is a JSON data structure for representing qualitative and quan-titative traits/characters and can be parsed by most programming languages. Supplementary Table 1 shows a formal description of charJSON in Ex-tended Backus-Naur Form.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n*  https://rawgithub.com/TRIN/jit/phylojive-test/examples/PhyloJive/hornworts.html \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nGarry Jolley-Rogers (@gjolleyrogers).\r\n It is a branch  of The JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit http://thejit.org.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
